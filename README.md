# PDF Darkmode

My eyes were hurting from reading CIS 1600 homework assignments in the dark, so I made this.

## Installation

The only dependency is PyPDF2, which can be installed with pip. Keep in mind that this uses an older version of PyPDF2(1.26.0) because I was too lazy to update my old utility script to work with the newer version (I'm sorry).

## Usage

```
$ pip install PyPDF2==1.26.0
$ python main.py [input file]
```
